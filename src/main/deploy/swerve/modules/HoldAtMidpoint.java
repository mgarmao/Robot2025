/*
Ok little guys, so we split you into 2 teams, team ved/shaurya and team rudra/arjun.
Team ved shaurya needs to make a new subsystem (like the corl subsystem thatâ€™s already there) with 2 spark max motors. 
Team arjun and rudra need to use the already existing corl subsystem but make a new file command (like the GoToSetpoint.java) using corl functions.
